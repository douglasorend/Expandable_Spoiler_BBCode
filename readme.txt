[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This modification adds a BBCode to the forum that allows the post author to hide a spoiler in the post, which is clickable to display it to the user.

This BBCode takes the form:
[code][nobbc]
[spoiler]{content}[/spoiler]
[spoiler text=Blah]{content}[/spoiler]
[spoiler quote="Blah"]{content}[/spoiler]
[/nobbc][/code]
Note that quotes are required for the [b]quote[/b] parameter, but not for the [b]text[/b] parameter.  These forms have no issues with other block-level tags inside the spoiler tag.

This BBCode can also take the following form:
[code][nobbc]
[spoiler=Some Text]{content goes here}[/spoiler]
[/nobbc][/code]
Note that, for this form, other block-level bbcode tags are not parsed inside this [b]spoiler[/b] tags form.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This BBCode may be disabled by going into the [b]Admin[/b] => [b]Forum[/b] => [b]Posts and Topics[/b] => [b]Bulletin Board Code[/b] and unchecking the bbcodes you don't want to use.  You may also be uninstall this mod in order to disable it.
